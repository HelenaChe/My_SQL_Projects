# SQL Project – Product and User Behavior Metrics (Part I)

This project includes example data and practice tasks for writing SQL queries.

**Part I** focuses on key product and user behavior metrics, such as:

- Daily / Weekly / Monthly active Users (DAU / WAU / MAU)
- Retention Rate
- Conversion Rate
- Repeat customers
- Top products by quantity sold
- Product popularity by category
- Average items per order
- Average time from sale to delivery
